# Simply combine images to PDF

**We do _NOT_ store or collect any personal data, files, or images**

## Usage and Features

Add blank pages  
Add images to the page currently selected (_A red arrow will show you which one is selected_)  
Select an image to move or resize  
Delete images by selecting them and pressing `Delete selected`  
Download as a single PDF file by pressing `IMG -> PDF`

## Why?

- Simple user interface and workflow that is useful for people who don't use technology
- Some older adults don't know how to use image/word processor programs, too many buttons and text
- Some "free" online image to PDF converters don't allow:
  - Multiple images on one page
  - Moving or resizing images

## Work in Progress (in order of importance)

- Ability to delete selected pages
- Responsive UI (and better mobile experience)
- Simple drawing features
- Drag and drop images to import them
- Import PDF files as images

## Additional info

This is my first "large" project using Next.js, so code quality will not be the greatest.  
**Expect bugs, data will be lost if the browser is closed or if the app crashes.**
