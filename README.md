# Combine images to PDF

## Why?

- Simple user interface and workflow that is useful for people who don't use technology
- Word processor programs that have the same features are too confusing or are not free
- Most other free online image to PDF converters don't allow:
  - Multiple images on one page
  - Moving or resizing images
  - Adding blank pages

## Usage and Features

- Add images to the page currently selected (_A red arrow will show you which one is selected_)
- Select an image to move or resize
- Delete images or pages by selecting them and pressing the trash icon
- Add blank pages for more space
- Download as a single PDF file by pressing `IMG -> PDF`

## Work in Progress (in order of importance)

- Specify pdf image export quality
- Drag and drop images to import them
